Title: Mouse gut OTU results 
Author: Mainye Ben 
Version: 0.1

This codebook is based on advice by J.Leek which can be found here:

Description:

This dataset was created by going through the tutorial 16S metabarcoding; It involved using the Morthur software to process 
fastq files made available to identify the species of bacteria present in the gut of a mouse paticularly this step 
http://77.235.253.122/tutorials/lessons/analysis/. In addition, the workflow followed is used by the Schloss laboratory at the 
University of Michigan in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology.

I preprocessed the file using regular expressions in an editor called TextWrangler resulting in a cleaner version called 
0.16.cons.taxonomy.csv. Check the repository to find this file.

Format:

A DataFrame with 106 rows and 9 columns 

Variables:

otu takes a string otu and number for example Otu001 this is just the count of each column.

size takes an integers. This is the abundance of the particular operational taxonomic unit.

identity contains strings. This is the common name of the observed organism which is mostly bacteria.

phylum contains strings. Part of the taxonomy. Level of classification lower than kingdom and above class.

class contains strings. Level of classification lower than phylum above order.

order contains strings. Level of classification lower than phylum above family.

family contains strings.Level of classification lower than phylum above genus.

genus contains strings. genus comes above species and below family. Another taxonomic rank.

genus_0 contains strings. Naturally this is supposed to be species, however, the bacteria found was mostly unclassified.

genus_1 contains strings. Seems to be a replicate of the previous column. Will change that soon.
